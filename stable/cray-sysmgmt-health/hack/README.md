Import Grafana Dashboards and Prometheus Rules
==============================================

Sync scripts:

* sync_grafana_dashboards.py (More extensive changes)
* sync_prometheus_rules.py (Updated chart name)

have been imported and modified as appropriate from
https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-operator/hack.
Prefer to only modify these scripts as necessary to support cray-shs.

Note: The k8s-coredns dashboard is *not* generated by
sync_grafana_dashboards.py. Instead, sync_k8s_coredns.sh is a custom script to
import and modify it directly from the prometheus-operator chart.

The included requirements.txt should assist in creating a virtual environment
suitable for running the sync scripts. After running each of the three sync
scripts, verify the updated templates and commit the results.
